# User Inputs Log

## [2024-01-09]

### User Request
1. "try making mp4 instead of two pass - make it in one pass"
   - Changed FFmpeg encoding to single-pass
   - Optimized settings for faster processing
   - Maintained quality with CRF 23

### Implementation Details
- Modified FFmpeg command for single-pass encoding
- Adjusted quality and speed parameters:
  ```diff
  - preset: medium -> veryfast
  - crf: 28 -> 23
  - profile: high -> main
  ```
- Removed unnecessary parameters
- Enhanced processing speed while maintaining quality

### Video Processing Optimization
1. Initial report: Video freezing for first three seconds while audio played normally
2. After first optimization: Freeze reduced to one second
3. After final optimization with single-pass cutting: User confirmed successful improvement ("good job")

### Key Learnings
- Two-pass approach had residual freeze issues
- Single-pass with keyframe analysis and accurate seeking proved more effective
- Audio/video sync and buffer optimization were critical factors
- Fragmented MP4 output with optimized settings resolved the initial playback delay
