To add functionality for cutting a portion of a video and downloading it directly from your website, you have several practical options, especially using JavaScript libraries that work entirely in the browser:

Recommended Approach
Use FFmpeg.js (WebAssembly port of FFmpeg):

FFmpeg.js lets you trim, cut, and process videos client-side in the browser, so users can select start and end times, cut the desired segment, and download it—no server needed.

You'll need to build a simple UI for users to pick the start/end times.

After selection, use FFmpeg.js to process the video and generate a downloadable file.

Basic Workflow:

User uploads or selects the video.

User sets start and end times for the desired clip.

FFmpeg.js processes the video in-browser to extract the segment.

The trimmed video is offered as a download.

Example FFmpeg.js Command:

js
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss [start_time] -to [end_time] -c copy output.mp4
You would run a similar command using FFmpeg.js API in your JavaScript code.

To minimize FFmpeg.wasm bundle size while maintaining video cutting functionality, implement these optimization strategies:

Core Optimization Techniques
1. Custom FFmpeg Build

Disable unnecessary components using compile-time flags:

bash
--disable-all --enable-demuxer=mov --enable-muxer=ipod \
--enable-protocol=file --enable-avformat --enable-avcodec
Reduces bundle from ~20MB to 1.8-5.2MB depending on features

2. Dynamic Import Loading

javascript
const loadFFmpeg = async () => {
  const { createFFmpeg } = await import('@ffmpeg/ffmpeg');
  return createFFmpeg({ corePath: '/custom-ffmpeg.js' });
};
Delays loading until user initiates video processing

Bundle Size Reduction Tactics
Technique	Size Reduction	Implementation Difficulty
Custom Build Flags	60-90%	Medium
Code Splitting	30-50%	Easy
WASM Compression	40-60%	Medium
CDN Hosting	0% (bandwidth)	Easy
3. Webpack Optimization

javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  externals: {
    '@ffmpeg/core': 'FFmpeg' // Load from CDN
  },
  experiments: {
    asyncWebAssembly: true
  }
};
Combine with bundle analyzer to remove duplicate dependencies

Recommended Production Setup
Host custom FFmpeg.wasm on CDN with Brotli compression

Implement service worker caching for WASM binaries

Use tree-shaking imports:

javascript
import { createFFmpeg, fetchFile } from '@ffmpeg/ffmpeg';
Memory Management

javascript
// After processing
ffmpeg.exit(); // Free WebAssembly memory[3]
ffmpeg = null;
These optimizations can reduce initial load size by 75-90% while maintaining video trimming capabilities. For a basic cutting feature, aim for a 2-3MB final bundle size using mov/ipod formats and h264 codec support.

FFmpeg Command-Line: Cut/Trim Video
Trim by Start and Duration

bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:05:20 -t 00:10:00 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
Cuts 10 minutes from input.mp4 starting at 5:20, saves to output.mp4.

Trim by Start and End Time

bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:10 -to 00:00:20 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
Cuts from 10s to 20s mark.

Trim Using the Filter (frame-accurate)

bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "trim=start=3:end=6,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS" output.mp4
Trims video from 3s to 6s using the filter (good for frame accuracy).

Using ffmpeg.wasm in the Browser (JavaScript Example)
Install ffmpeg.wasm:

bash
npm install @ffmpeg/ffmpeg
Basic Usage in React/JS:

javascript
import { createFFmpeg, fetchFile } from '@ffmpeg/ffmpeg';

const ffmpeg = createFFmpeg({ log: true });

async function trimVideo(inputFile, start, duration) {
  await ffmpeg.load();
  ffmpeg.FS('writeFile', 'input.mp4', await fetchFile(inputFile));
  await ffmpeg.run('-ss', `${start}`, '-t', `${duration}`, '-i', 'input.mp4', '-c', 'copy', 'output.mp4');
  const data = ffmpeg.FS('readFile', 'output.mp4');
  return new Blob([data.buffer], { type: 'video/mp4' });
}
start and duration are in seconds.

This function returns a trimmed video blob you can offer for download.

Tips for Reducing ffmpeg.wasm Bundle Size
Custom Build: Remove unnecessary codecs and features from FFmpeg before compiling to WASM.

Dynamic Import: Load ffmpeg.wasm only when needed (e.g., when user clicks “Trim”).

CDN Hosting: Host the WASM binary on a CDN and load it dynamically.

Tree-Shaking: Import only the functions you use.
